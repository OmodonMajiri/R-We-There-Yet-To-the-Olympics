# R-We-There-Yet-To-the-Olympics
## Project Rationale
<p> We decided to pick a project that would showcase the global history of countries worldwide, coming together to one location, and having some good friendly competitions during the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Our goal is to visualize some patterns throughout the Olympic Games history. Some of the patterns presented are following: </p>

* How many athletes and nations participated throughout the history of the Olympics 
* What were the demographics of the athletes:
    - ID - Unique number for each athlete 
    - Name
    - Sex
    - Age 
    - Height (cm) 
    - Weight (kg) 
* What sports were part of the Olympics throughout history
* Which countries won the most medals(gold, silver and bronze) 
* Amongst others as we dive deeper into the data
